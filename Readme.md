# Bevy Helper Tools

This package contains different helpers I created for my own games in Bevy. This helpers are:

* `assets_generator`: An small script to build an enum with all the Assets you have
* `assets_helper`: A package required by assets_generator, as provides a trait. 
* `ui_helpers`: Different helpers that can be used in the UI, to control the buttons or also to handle a loading screen
